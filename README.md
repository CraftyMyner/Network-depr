# Network
An implementation of a Minecraft Spigot server Core plugin.
This is purely for my fun and experience and is not intended for use on a server.

## Systems used:
- Storage/Caching: MongoDB + Redis
- Communication between servers: Bungee Messaging Channel + Redis
- Unit Testing: JUNit + Mockito

## Current features:
- Ranks system
- Chat handling
- Language support: Easy support for adding new languages for users to choose from
- Command framework: An annotation-based command framework allowing multiple commands per class, where all command arguments are embedded in the method signature
